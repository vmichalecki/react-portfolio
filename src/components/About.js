                Hi! Fancy meeting you here. I'm Valerie. I'm an adaptable, eager, and
                talented full stack developer who left New York City behind but took my
                accent and ambition with me. I love programming and debugging in JavaScript. I
                invite you to take a dive into some of projects below.
            </p>
